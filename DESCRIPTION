Title: Variable-Resolution Heat Maps
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("Chris", "Comiskey", email = "cwcomiskey@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides a function to create variable resolution 
    heat maps (VRHMs). VRHMs specialize in heat maps for spatial data 
    whose density varies over the domain, such that it makes sense to have 
    regionally defined resolution. The function determines resolution 
    according to a user specified stopping rule.
